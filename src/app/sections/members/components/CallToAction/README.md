##README

This folder contains components that group call to action buttons and aligns items to the center. It is styled with a grey background to allow the buttons to stand out. Components to align buttons to the left and right can be added as needed.

Note: In the future, fixed sticky headers will be implemented so that the buttons can follow the user as they scroll through forms.  

Use case:

```
<CallToAction>
  <ProfileSaveButton
      onSaveClick={saveButton}
  />
</CallToAction>
```
